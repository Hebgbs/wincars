Huh?
====
This is a directory full of vehicles successfully turned into clockwork cars.
Edit gamepath.bat to reflect your Re-Volt / RVGL location and have fun.
It will search for either Re-Volt or RVGL, by executable name before proceeding.

To apply changes, open the car you want (if you have it already) and run the batch files therein.
If you don't have the car, you will be prompted to download via Re-Volt Zone.
To undo changes, manually edit your game to restore the original wincar4; it's in \cars.

How does this really work?
==========================
Each batch file will execute other files therein;
gamepath.bat defines where the game is. If these scripts are unable to function fix them. (Do not subvert error checking.)
filechk.bat will 1) check if revolt.exe exists, if not, 2) check for rvgl.exe and if it finds the game, 3) check for the car specific to the script executed.
lnchoice.bat is for determining link behaviour, and produces the file .lncmd.bat.
The scripts will seek out .lncmd.bat for knowing what to do; either symbolic links or hard links. If .lncmd.bat doesn't exist it will call upon lnchoice.bat.
When completed, the script inside the cars directory to be affected (which ends in _cc.bat) will symbolically link all files therein so target acts as clockwork.
Open the game, load Clockwork Carnage and enjoy thirty of any vehicle you've chosen.

You'll want to download the whole archive, or install Github for desktop and sync with me for keeping up with future releases. Don't be shy to send me suggestions for cars!
